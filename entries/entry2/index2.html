    'oh, I was watching this video on youtube the other day. think it was Vox or something. some lady went to this place called 'Slab City' somewhere in rural California. they talked about it being lawless, cut off from civilization, something about police not interfering. I can't remember what the reasoning was. what if I just fucked off to Slab City. no one would know and I can live out another life, fresh start, whatever that means' they were pissed.
