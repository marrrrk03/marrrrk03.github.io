        that time we tripped,<br>
        I said you were a wooden cabin in the woods during a never ending winter, <br>
        plagued by an indefinite cold spell, <br>
        condemned <br>
        icebound <br>
        lit by a bourbon fueled fireplace that wouldn’t ever go out. <br>

        <div style="width: 60%; padding-top: 72px;">

        I also remember saying she is a mountain lake I walked past during early winter <br>
        a thin sheet of ice glazed over the surface of the water <br>
        jumping in naked and then sticking my head out to smell the frost and the remainder of the plant life <br>

        <br><br>

        I said that I was the smell of rubber tires burning <br>
        against the tarmac road in the desert. <br>
        three large kerosene tanks casting long shadows over the arid landscape during an perpetual sunset <br>
        a Shell disappearing into the distance <br>

        <br><br>

        <div class="two_column_flex">

        <div style="width: 60%;">
        
        we were sitting on the tiled bathroom floor, <br>
        the walls pulsating, <br>
        the reflection of our figures throbbing in the mirror. <br>
        we were half leaning against each other and half leaning against the side of the bathtub. <br>
        you said I was your black and white and silver, <br>
        Jessina thought it was a reference to early photography <br>

        <br>
        
        I squat and lean back like some jackass Asian tourist <br>
        to take photos of you so I can swipe through them when you’re not here. <br>
        there’s that Chinese tourist who shat at the the botanical gardens in Sydney <br>
        there’s a rumor that the cops made him eat his own shit <br>
        I’ll stuff my face with shit for you as if I was a senior citizen at a Golden Corral <br>
