        i like painting my nails <br>
        like a little girl <br>
        
        <img class="teacherpic" src="imgs7/teacher.jpg" alt="a teacher"> 
        <div class="teacher">ok everybody, lets get into a single file, boy girl boy girl</div>
        
        <br>

        my grandma cried when she saw my black nails. <br>
        maybe it was because <br>
        i directly drenched a new layer of black over the old chipped bits. <br>
        index finger print gouged into my thumb nail <br>

        <img class="teacherpic" src="imgs7/teacher.jpg" alt="a teacher">
        <div class="teacher">Mark, what did you bring in today for show and tell?</div>

        <br>

        i have this ring with a thing of moonstone in it. <br>
        moonstone is suppose to represent 'feminine divinity' <br>
        not sure what that's suppose to mean <br>  
        but i feel lucky when i wear it. <br>
        placebo probably <br>

        <img class="teacherpic" src="imgs7/teacher.jpg" alt="a teacher">
        <div class="teacher">you have to tie your hair back if it touches your shoulder. i've got rubber bands if you need one</div>

        <br>

        we went to the haircut place. <br>
        mom paid for the haircut. <br>
        fuck me, he's so punchable <br>
        short black hair with the glasses with the graphic t-shirt. <br>
        dad doesn't think i'm an eyesore anymore. <br>

        <img class="teacherpic" src="imgs7/teacher.jpg" alt="a teacher">
        <div class="teacher">who wants to share with the class what they did over the weekend?</div>

        <br>

        could i get a medium pumpkin spice latte with less ice, regular cream and sugar <br>
        i like Target <br>
        'Up and Up' and 'Great Value' make me happy <br>
        Red is Taylor's best album <br>
        my ex called me an <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold; color: green;">astrology</span>
         whore <br>
        that also made me happy

        my grandma cried. <br>
        she was very upset that night. <br>
        she called me this silly phrase in cantonese <br>
        roughly translates into 'not boy not girl' <br>
        i think it's pretty funny. <br>
        i'm pretty sure she didn't think it was pretty funny <br>
        <br>
        what if i had green eyes? <br>
        a vibrant green grey with strong yellow undertones <br>
